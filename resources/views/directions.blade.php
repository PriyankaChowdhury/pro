	<h1>Directions</h1>
	<p>Directions:  It’s super easy to get to The Monkey Farm in Costa Rica, see the map below. Off the main street in Playas del Coco, follow the “road to Ocotal”, just past Rich Coast Diving on your left and Pollo Crispy on your right. Follow this road and the signs going to Father Rooster. When you see the signs on the road to Ocotal pointing down the dirt road on your left, you can follow them to come in the back entrance. The Monkey Farm in Costa Rica.</p>

<p>If you prefer a smoother ride, go in the Ocotal guard gate like you are going to Father Rooster, but as soon as you go through the gate, make an immediate hard left turn (almost a u) and follow that road up the hill. Keep going as it winds around until you start to go downhill a little and you will see a cell phone tower up ahead on your left. Turn left right beside and just past the cell tower and go down the hill.  You’ll see the barn and other buildings on the left. That’s where we are.</p>

<p>GPS Coordinates: N 10 degrees 32.68 ft. W 085 degrees 43.274 ft.</p>

<p>Mailing Address: The Monkey Farm, Camino del Cielo, Playa Ocotal, Guanacaste, Costa Rica 50503</p>
